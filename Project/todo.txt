X train with the NRMSE normalized by the mean with more epochs --> NRMSE loss approaces nan value
X try to write the NRMSE by normalizing with the range (max-min, but handle the max=min case by computing the RMSE divided by the mean of the values) --> loss approaches nan value again
X retrain with both of those versions, with LeakyReLU instead of PReLU --> loss approaches nan value again
X replace the Adam optimizer with RMSprop --> loss approaches nan value again
X reduce the number of layers in the model --> loss approaches nan value again 
X try with MSE and with both Adam and RMSprop
	- MSE + RMSprop --> the network learns appropriately, considering that the value of the MSE loss decreases
	- MSE + Adam --> the network learns appropriately, considering that the value of the MSE loss decreases
X create plots with the training and validation loss
