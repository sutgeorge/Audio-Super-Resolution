A project focused on the super-resolution of audio signals i.e improving sound quality of a digital recording, be it a vocal recording or music. 

## Dataset
The datasets used will be VCTK and some music dataset, possibly MagnaTagATune or The Million Song dataset.

## Possible uses
 - Improving sound quality of music
	- insanely experimental and slightly unrealistic idea: use [Deezer's model for separating tracks of a song](https://towardsdatascience.com/separate-music-tracks-with-deep-learning-be4cf4a2c83) and apply transfer learning to upsample each track separately (train a model with low-res/high-res guitar tracks, one with bass tracks, one for drums and another for voice tracks)  
 - Voice-over-IP applications
 - Improving speech recognition
 - Remastering audio from old movies
 - Reconstructing old phonograph recordings (This one might be a bit far-fetched, since a lot of data is needed. It might actually be impossible.)

## Converting a spectrogram to audio (might be useful later)
The Python module [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) can transform an audio signal into a spectrogram and vice-versa
by using the [Griffin-Lim algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61132574/can-i-convert-spectrograms-generated-with-librosa-back-to-audio).

		- What are the tools/techniques used?
		- How did the authors evaluate their solution?
		- What are the results of the experiments?

	3. Question everything
		- Do I understand everything the authors say?
		- Is the paper sound?
		- What would I have done differently?
		- Read referenced research papers
		- Internalise the math
		- Re-think the problem
		- Explain the paper to friends/colleagues

	4. Check the code
		- Check the author's implementation

## A quick implementation of ["Audio Super Resolution Using Neural Networks (Kuleshov, Enam, Ermon, 2017)"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00853v1.pdf)

### First stage

![Data generation, training and testing diagram in stage 1](Paper/AudioSuperResolution/diagram_stage_1.png)  

<img src="Project/model_stage_1.png" alt="model_stage_1" align="center" width="50%"/>

 - [X] Write the data generator scripts (obtaining the low-res/high-res pairs of audio clips)
 - [X] Write the training/testing scripts 
 - [X] read more about why the loss approaches the nan value during training 
	 -  usually, it is either because of an exploding gradient or a vanishing gradient (in my case, I accidentally used NRMSE as a loss function instead of using it only as a metric, the number was so small that Keras displayed the loss as being "nan")
	 - relevant StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37232782/nan-loss-when-training-regression-network 
 - [X] create plots with the training and validation loss
 - [X] train 100 epochs
 - [X] adjust the data split to use all of the generated data from the first 100 tracks of VCTK for training/validation/testing
 - [X] Finish testing/prediction script:
	- [X] Downsample test audio track
	- [X] Feed chunks of 256 samples of the audio to the model 
	- [X] Display spectrogram of the output
	- [X] Save the low-res/high-res/super-res numpy arrays as audio and compare them

### Second stage

![Data generation, training and testing diagram in stage 2](Paper/AudioSuperResolution/diagram_stage_2.png)  

<img src="Project/model_stage_2.png" alt="model_stage_2" align="center" width="50%"/>

 - [X] Display the 5-number summary / boxplot of the generated dataset
 - [X] Create line plot of a couple of random samples (both in time-domain and in frequency-domain)
 - [X] Create histogram of a single sample 
 - [X] Check what size a chunk could have (transform the numpy array chunk of size n to WAV and listen to the result)
 - [X] Implement checkpoint restoration
 - [X] Generate the dataset again with a chunk size of 4800 samples (100ms), an overlap of 2400 samples (50ms) and a downsampling factor of 4 (the reason for this patch size is that the paper mentions a similar size of 6000 samples used in 400 training epochs) 
	- [X] Use 4 processes to speed up the data generation 
 - [X] Add 3 more upsampling blocks (a subpixel layer is not enough to upsample a 1200-sample tensor to 4800 samples and has no parameters)
 - [X] Reconstruct the low-resolution signal without applying interpolation (e.g a 100-sample chunk downsampled with a factor of 4 becomes a chunk of length 25, which will be fed to the network as-is without interpolation)
 - [X] Get evaluation metrics (NRMSE comparisons for the high-res/super-res signals and the high-res/interpolated signals)
 - [X] Display some scatterplots
 - [X] Compare the 5e-4 learning rate model with the 100-epoch 1e-4 model and the 200-epoch 1e-4 model

### 3rd stage

<img src="Project/model_stage_3.png" alt="model_stage_3" align="center" width="50%"/>

 - [X] Increase the number of filters in the Conv1D layers from 32 to 64 and train

### 4th stage

<img src="Project/model_stage_4.png" alt="model_stage_4" align="center" width="50%"/>
 
 - [X] Set the filter no. configuration to 64-128-256-256-256-128-64, with the last 2 upsampling blocks retaining the 64-64 arrangement

### 5th stage

<img src="Project/model_stage_5.png" alt="model_stage_5" align="center" width="50%"/>

 - [X] Add BatchNorm to the downsampling blocks

### 6th stage

 - [X] Perform an ablation study to analyze how much each residual block contributes to the noise found in the model output

### 7th stage

<img src="Project/model_stage_7.png" alt="model_stage_5" align="center" width="50%"/>

 - [X] Replace the normal convolutions with depthwise separable 1D convolutions as an experiment
